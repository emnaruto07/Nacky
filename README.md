## Bypass Network Access Control (NAC, 802.1x)

## Requirements
The basic requirement for an NAC bypass is access to a device that has already been authenticated. This device is used to log into the network and then smuggle in network packages from a different device. This involves placing the attackerâ€™s system between the network switch and the authenticated device. One way to do this is with a Raspberry Pi and two network adapters.
